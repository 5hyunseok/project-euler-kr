One of the possible chains is shown below:<br>\n2 &#x2194; 3 &#x2194; 13 &#x2194; 113 &#x2194; 103 &#x2194; 107 &#x2194; 127<br>\nHowever, 11 and 103 are not 2&apos;s relatives.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet F(N) be the sum of the primes &#x2264; N which are not 2&apos;s relatives.<br>\nWe can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n</p>\n","title_kr":"","problem_kr":""}
