{"id":406,"number":406,"title":"Guessing Game","problem":"\n<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \nEach number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br></p><ul><li> &quot;Your guess is lower than the hidden number&quot; (and you incur a cost of <var>a</var>), or</li>\n<li> &quot;Your guess is higher than the hidden number&quot; (and you incur a cost of <var>b</var>), or</li>\n<li> &quot;Yes, that&apos;s it!&quot; (and the game ends).</li>\n</ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if <var>n</var> = 5, <var>a</var> = 2, and <var>b</var> = 3, then we may begin by asking &quot;<b>2</b>&quot; as our first question.</p>\n\n<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that &quot;<b>1</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>3</b></span>).<br>\nIf we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be &quot;<b>4</b>&quot;.<br>\nIf we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that &quot;<b>3</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>5</b></span>).<br>\nIf we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that &quot;<b>5</b>&quot; is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>4</b></span>).<br>\nThus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. \nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n\n<p>Let C(<var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few examples:<br>\nC(5, 2, 3) = 5<br>\nC(500, &#x221A;2, &#x221A;3) = 13.22073197...<br>\nC(20000, 5, 7) = 82<br>\nC(2000000, &#x221A;5, &#x221A;7) = 49.63755955...</p>\n\n<p>Let F<sub><var>k</var></sub> be the Fibonacci numbers: F<sub><var>k</var></sub> = F<sub><var>k</var>-1</sub> + F<sub><var>k</var>-2</sub> with base cases F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> = 1.<br>Find &#x2211;<sub>1&#x2264;<var>k</var>&#x2264;30</sub>&#xA0;C(10<sup>12</sup>, &#x221A;<var>k</var>, &#x221A;F<sub><var>k</var></sub>), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n","title_kr":"","problem_kr":""}
