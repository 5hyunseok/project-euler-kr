{"id":252,"number":256,"title":"Tatami-Free Rooms","problem":"\n<span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">\n</span><p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1&#xD7;2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>\n\n<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>&#xB7;<var>b</var>.<br>\nWe use the term &apos;size&apos; to denote the floor surface area of the room, and &#x2014; without loss of generality &#x2014; we add the condition <var>a</var> &#x2264; <var>b</var>.</p>\n\n<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br>\nFor example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4&#xD7;4 room:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p256_tatami3.gif\" alt=\"p256_tatami3.gif\"><br></div>\n\n<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red &quot;<span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>X</b></span>&quot; in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br>\nFurther, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.</p>\n\n<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7&#xD7;10.<br>\nAll the other rooms of size <var>s</var> = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1&#xD7;70, 2&#xD7;35 and 5&#xD7;14.<br>\nHence, <var>T</var>(70) = 1.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:<br>\n20&#xD7;66, 22&#xD7;60, 24&#xD7;55, 30&#xD7;44 and 33&#xD7;40.<br>\nIn fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.</p>\n\n<p>Find the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 200.</p>\n\n\n","title_kr":"","problem_kr":""}
