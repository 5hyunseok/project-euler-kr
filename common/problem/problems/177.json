An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are 45&#xB0;. Another example is given by DAC = 20&#xB0;, BAC = 60&#xB0;, ABD = 50&#xB0;, CBD = 30&#xB0;, BCA = 40&#xB0;, DCA = 30&#xB0;, CDB = 80&#xB0;, ADB = 50&#xB0;.</p>\n<p>What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?</p>\n<p>Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of 10<sup>-9</sup> of an integer value.</p>\n","title_kr":"","problem_kr":""}
