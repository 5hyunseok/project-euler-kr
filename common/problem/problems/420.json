{"id":419,"number":420,"title":"2x2 positive integer matrix","problem":"\n<p>A <i>positive integer matrix</i> is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.<br>\nSome positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p420_matrix.gif\" alt=\"p420_matrix.gif\"></div>\n\n<p>\nWe define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a <dfn title=\"the sum of the elements on the main diagonal\">trace</dfn> less than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.<br>\nWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n</p>\n","title_kr":"","problem_kr":""}
